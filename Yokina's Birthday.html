            <h2>How I met Yokina</h2>
            <p>Yokina has been my friend since 2021 and it was somewhere during the start of the 3rd term that i met her.
                We actually met accidentally because i was in the same class as her cousin named Jonathan. 
                Jonathan decide that one day we will play chess online and I agree and we got the app Chess.com and began playing online.
                A few days had passed since me and Jonathan started playing chess online but on one particular day, Jonathan didn't seem like his usual self, i paid it no mind
                little did i know that a special somone who will forever be in my life had entered. 
                I got a massage from Jonathan on whatsapp saying someone hacked his phone and is playing chess with me.
                i was confused of course and therefore i started talking to this person i was versing and i won't lie it was the best decision of my life that i made.
                After that incounter Me and This beautiful and wonderful woman played chess nearly everyday because it was the only way we could communicate as well.
                Appearantly her and Jonathan had linked accounts or phones because even on whatsapp she would talk while he was talking so at some point if you looked at my whatsapp
                you would think im talking to a sycophath because it would be a one sided messaged of somone talking to them self hahaha.

            <h2>What type of person is Yokina?</h2>
            <p>Yokina is a sturbborn,Difficult and a big Meanie.
                hahaha im joking actually im not but on a serious not she is an amazing girl, like she has a soft heart for people and the love she has for the Lord is expressed to people.
                She is caring beyond belief, she doesn't know how to be mean unless its to me of course i find it unfair. 
                When you think of a mother figure for your kids Yokina is the girl, when you think of a wife Yokina is the girl
